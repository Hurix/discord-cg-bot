The initiative, dubbed \u2018Operation Andronicus\u2019, has been expressly conceived to counter Thargoid aggression in the region.\r\n\r\nAdmiral Aden Tanner, Aegis\u2019s chief military liaison, elaborated on the nature of the initiative:\r\nPersonal-scale craft are particularly effective against Thargoid vessels, not least because of the comparative vulnerability of capital-class ships. I therefore believe the most effective way to address the Thargoid threat \u2013 in the short term at least \u2013 is a militia of seasoned combat pilots. Aegis has agreed to finance this initiative, which will aim to deliver a strategic blow to the Thargoids in the Pleiades Sector IR-W d1-55.\r\n\r\nAegis Research has confirmed that it will reward pilots who hand in Pilots Federation Combat Bonds at The Oracle in the Pleiades Sector IR-W d1-55.",
